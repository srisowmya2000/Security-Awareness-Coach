Security Awareness Coach

Security Awareness Coach is an AI-powered workflow built with n8n and Claude (Anthropic API) to help teams and individuals stay sharp on cybersecurity, one question at a time.

It automatically turns current cybersecurity headlines into a plain-English summary and a multiple-choice awareness question, delivered directly to your inbox.

🚀 Features

Fetches real-time cybersecurity news from BleepingComputer
Summarises and generates questions via Claude (Anthropic API)
Sends a formatted email with a summary + quiz question via Gmail
Can run on a schedule (daily/weekly)

💡 Why Use This

Traditional security awareness training is long, boring, and infrequent.

This workflow brings:

Bite-sized microlearning
Real-world context (based on actual breaches/fixes)
Knowledge reinforcement via daily quiz-style delivery
